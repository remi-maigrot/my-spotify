## üöÄ Main Features

1. **Music Search:** Users can search for songs using the Spotify API.
2. **Music Player:** An integrated player allows users to listen to tracks.
3. **Personal Playlists:** Users can add songs to a private, browser-stored playlist.
4. **Personalized Recommendations:** Recommendations are generated based on the user‚Äôs playlist. These recommendations utilize an **ontology** to establish relationships between artists and albums.

## üìñ Ontology Usage Description

In MySpotify, the ontology is used to structure and establish relationships between various musical elements such as artists, albums, and songs. These relationships enable:

- Analyzing the user‚Äôs playlist to extract associated artists and albums.
- Comparing these artists and albums with available tracks to provide relevant recommendations.

The idea is that users are likely to enjoy songs from the same artists or albums already present in their playlist.

### Example Code Illustrating Ontology Usage in the Application:

```typescript
export interface Track {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  artists: Array<{
    id: string,
    name: string;
  }>;
  album: {
    name: string;
    images: Array<{
      url: string;
    }>;
  };
  preview_url: string;
}

export interface PlaylistTrack extends Track {
  addedAt: string;
}
```

#### Quick Code Explanation:

- **`Track` :** Represents a music track with:
  - `id` : Unique identifier for the song.
  - `name` : Name of the song.
  - `artists` : List of associated artists, each with a unique identifier (`id`) and a name (`name`).
  - `album` : Album information, including its name and images (e.g., the cover).
  - `preview_url` : URL to listen to a song preview.
  
- **`PlaylistTrack` :** Extends the `Track` interface by adding an `addedAt` property, which indicates when the track was added to the playlist.

These structures clearly define relationships between tracks, artists, and albums, which are then used to generate recommendations.
